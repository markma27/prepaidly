# Code Standards

## Language Requirement

**All code, comments, documentation, and user-facing text MUST be in English.**

This includes:
- Source code comments
- Variable names and function names
- User interface text
- Error messages
- Documentation files
- Commit messages
- Code reviews

### Rationale

- English is the standard language for international software development
- Ensures codebase accessibility for global team members
- Maintains consistency across the project
- Facilitates collaboration and code reviews

### Exceptions

- Only exception: Test data or demo content that specifically requires non-English text for testing purposes (e.g., testing internationalization features)

## Enforcement

- Code reviews should reject any non-English text
- Linters should flag non-English strings in user-facing text
- Documentation should be written in English
