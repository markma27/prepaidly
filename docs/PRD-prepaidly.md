# Prepaidly.io ‚Äì Product Requirements Document v1.0
**Date:** December 2024  
**Author:** Product Team  
**Status:** Active Development  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

### üè¢ Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture
**Prepaidly.io is a multi-tenant SaaS web application** where multiple organizations (entities) and their users share the same infrastructure while maintaining complete data isolation and security.

### üîí Data Security Priority
**SECURITY IS PARAMOUNT** - This application handles sensitive financial data for multiple organizations. Every feature, component, and database interaction MUST implement proper security measures:

- **Complete tenant isolation** - No organization can access another's data
- **Row-level security** on all database operations
- **Entity-based access controls** at all application layers
- **Encrypted data at rest and in transit**
- **Audit trails** for all data access and modifications
- **Zero-trust architecture** - verify permissions at every layer

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Small to medium-sized businesses struggle with accurate prepayment and unearned revenue recognition, leading to:

- **Financial Reporting Errors**: Manual tracking in spreadsheets creates calculation mistakes and inconsistent reporting
- **Compliance Risks**: Incorrect revenue recognition violates accounting standards (ASC 606, IFRS 15)
- **Time Inefficiency**: Finance teams spend 5-10 hours monthly on manual schedule calculations
- **Audit Complications**: Lack of proper documentation and audit trails increases compliance costs
- **Cash Flow Mismanagement**: Poor visibility into future revenue recognition impacts business decisions

**Core Pain Point**: No affordable, user-friendly solution exists for businesses that need more than spreadsheets but less than enterprise ERP systems.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Prepaidly.io is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** that automates prepayment and unearned revenue schedule management through:

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform hours of manual spreadsheet work into minutes of automated schedule generation with built-in compliance and audit readiness.

**Multi-Tenant Architecture Benefits**:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure reduces per-customer costs
- **Scalability**: Seamless scaling across thousands of organizations
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security for businesses of all sizes
- **Compliance**: Centralized compliance and audit capabilities

**Key Differentiators**:
- Single-purpose focus (vs. complex ERP modules)
- Intuitive manual-entry workflow (vs. technical accounting software)
- Immediate visual previews (vs. black-box calculations)
- Export-ready formats (vs. proprietary reporting)
- **Multi-tenant security** (vs. single-tenant vulnerabilities)
