# Nixpacks configuration for Railway
# IMPORTANT: Configure Railway to build from repository ROOT (not cronjob subdirectory)
# In Railway dashboard: Service Settings → Root Directory → Set to "/" or leave empty
# If Railway builds from cronjob directory, this config will work but backend won't be available
